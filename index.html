    I am Associate Professor (tenured) at the <a href="https://https://iut.univ-amu.fr/en/">Aix-Marseille Institute of Technology</a> and Researcher at the <a href="https://https://www.lis-lab.fr/en/home/">Computer Science and Systems Laboratory</a>  (LIS – Laboratoire d’Informatique et Systèmes – UMR 7020).

    My research is mainly focused on <strong>data mining</strong> (a subfield of data science), and especially <strong>pattern mining</strong>. The main objective of pattern mining is to extract hidden patterns in complex data (heterogeneous, volumous, noisy, etc.). I have studied various types of patterns (sets, sequences and graphs), most of them being related to <strong>spatio-temporal data</strong> (e.g. time series of satellite images). Lately, I also work on representation learning (program embeddings) and agent learning in Agent Based Models.

    I am a member of the <strong>Data Science</strong> department and more particularly of the  <strong>"Data Mining at scale (DANA)"</strong> team. I have participated to several interdisciplinary research projects dealing with various questions s.t. soil erosion, dengue fever spread, informal settlements or education.
