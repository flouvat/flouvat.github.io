    I am Full Professor (tenured) at the <a href="https://https://iut.univ-amu.fr/en/">Aix-Marseille Institute of Technology</a> and Researcher at the <a href="https://https://www.lis-lab.fr/en/home/">Computer Science and Systems Laboratory</a>  (LIS – Laboratoire d’Informatique et Systèmes – UMR 7020).

    My research is mainly focused on <strong>data science</strong> (a subfield of Artificial Intelligence). In the past, I mainly worked on  <strong>pattern mining</strong>. The main objective of pattern mining is to extract hidden patterns in complex data (heterogeneous, volumous, noisy, etc.). I have studied various types of patterns (sets, sequences and graphs), most of them being related to <strong>spatio-temporal data</strong> (e.g. time series of satellite images).
    <br>
    Lately, I am interested in developing innovative methods and tools for <strong>data-centric AI</strong>. This paradigm recognizes that the performance of AI systems relies not only on models but also on how data is collected, prepared, and explored. Currently, I am  working in particular on <strong>representation learning</strong> (program embeddings) and <strong>agent learning</strong> in Agent Based Models.

    I am a member of the <strong>Data Science</strong> department and more particularly of the  <a href="https://www.lis-lab.fr/iacd/"><strong>Data Centric AI (DCAI)</strong> team</a>, of which I am one of the co-leaders. I have participated to several interdisciplinary research projects dealing with various questions s.t. soil erosion, dengue fever spread, urban growth or education.
