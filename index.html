    My research is mainly focused on <strong>data mining</strong> (a subfield of data science), and especially <strong>pattern mining</strong>. The main objective of pattern mining is to extract hidden patterns in complex data (heterogeneous, volumous, noisy, etc.). I have studied various types of patterns (sets, sequences and graphs), most of them being related to <strong>spatio-temporal data</strong> (e.g. time series of satellite images).

    I work in an <strong>interdisciplinary</strong> research laboratory that brings together biologists, geologists, physicists, chemists, mathematicians and computer scientists to address both fundamental and applied questions related to the concepts of <strong>risk and sustainable development</strong>. I am more particularly involved in the research them <strong>"Observation, Modelisation and Simulation"</strong>. I have participated to several national and regional research projects dealing with various questions s.t. soil erosion, dengue fever spread, informal settlements or education.
