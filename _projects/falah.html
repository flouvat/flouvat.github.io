description: "This research network focuses on family farming and food in the Pacific Islands. 
It involves fifteen multidisciplinary teams at local, regional and international levels (Europe, Vanuatu, Fiji, Salomon, New-Caledonia and Australia). 
The main objective is to build a network of research teams operating in the Pacific Islands that have a common interest in food security and its direct or indirect relationship with the environment, lifestyle and health.
The final goal is to promote and revitalize family agriculture to improve the health of Pacific populations and ensure food security in the context of rapid social and economic transformations and climate change."
