description: "Faced with growing urbanization, informal settlements are an integral part of the urban landscape in the Pacific island states.
Improving living conditions of populations has become a major issue. For this, stakeholders need indicators and tools to better understand and plan evolutions of these communities w.r.t. their environment.
The objective of this multidisciplinary project is to analyze and modelize the  dynamics of informal settlements based on GIS data, satellite images, drone data and household surveys.
Agent-based modeling will be used to simulate informal settlements dynamics. Then,  data mining techniques will be used to analyzed simulation results, and improve the model.     
To construct its generic model, this project more particularly study six informal settlements in Vanuatu, Solomon Islands and Fiji."
