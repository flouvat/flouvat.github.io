  description: "The SITI project aims at developing knowledge and new agent-based simulation tools to analyze dynamics of informal settlements in the capital cities of the Pacific islands (Port-Vila, Suva and Noumea). By crossing different research protocols and methods usually distant from each other (written archives, observations, open interviews, semi-directive interviews, questionnaires, spatial data, econometrics and artificial intelligence), the aim is to have a full understanding of the urban dynamics that have produced and perpetuated informal settlements in the three Pacific cities. To achieve this, this project is based on an interdisciplinary approach involving history, urban planning, geography, economics, remote sensing and artificial intelligence."

  description: "Faced with growing urbanization, informal settlements are an integral part of the urban landscape in the Pacific island states.
  Improving living conditions of populations has become a major issue. For this, stakeholders need indicators and tools to better understand and plan evolutions of these communities w.r.t. their environment.
  The objective of this multidisciplinary project is to analyze and modelize the  dynamics of informal settlements based on GIS data, satellite images, drone data and household surveys.
  Agent-based modeling will be used to simulate informal setllements dynamics. To construct its generic model, this projet more particularly study six informal settlements in Vanuatu, Solomon Islands and Fiji."

  In both applications, a very large amount of data is recorded daily to monitor production, equipment and weather conditions. 
  These data are in the form of multivariate time series (numerical and symbolic). The objective of this work is to develop new methods / algorithms to make prediction from such data.  "

In order to have a sustainable development, it is important for the company to have effective decision support systems to better understand, monitor and manage the environment.

  description: "The FOSTER project aims at providing to geologists a semi-automatic and complete process for monitoring soil erosion. This process will be based on multi-temporal very high resolution satellite images coupled with digital elevation model (DEM), sensor data and/or expert knowledge. The project will focus more precisely on two important aspects of this process: segmentation of satellite images based on collaborative methods, and construction of descriptive (patterns, clustering,...) and predictive (decision trees,...) spatio-temporal models. This project focuses his study on New Caledonia, a biodiversity hotspot and a first rank environmental observatory. Protecting and managing such a fragile environment due to major mining projects and an increasing population, are major challenges. To valid the genericity of the proposed process, the project will also study another geographical area in the southern part of French Alps."

  description: "These last years an increasing amount of data has been collected to study spread of infectious diseases. Extracting knowledge to better understand the dynamic of these phenomena is a challenging task. For example, dengue epidemics are characterized by a set of interacting factors, causing the spread of the disease in space and time. It is important to know, how and which factors have an effect on disease spread. Even if the global influence of environmental factors (water points, nearby mangrove, rainfall, humidity etc.) is known, the impact of all the factors together with their interactions stills an open problem. In this context, the project aims at discovering and modeling the dynamic of dengue epidemics. This study focuses on New Caledonia and its capital city Nouméa."

  description: "Although guided by real problems, data mining techniques are still marginally used and their implementation can only be carried out by specialists programmers familiar with low-level code. The technology transfer is thus slowed down by some limitations, among which the time necessary to the development of operational programs. We consider here an important and broad class of data mining problems: the discovery of interesting patterns in large databases. From a theoretical point of view, these problems must be representable as sets. In this setting, we propose a library facilitating the resolution of such problems, based on the use of generic and scalable algorithms. The characteristics and optimizations of the algorithms are transparent for the programmer, and only the development of the specific properties of its problem is left to him/her. The library, called iZi and developed in C++, is available under GNU General Public License. For more details, see the technical documentation."
